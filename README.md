# Flow
This is a pet project based on the set of mobile games called Flow Free created by Big Duck Games. I have always loved playing these games and thought I'd take a crack at an algorithmic approach to solving these puzzles.

## A Brief Overview of the Game
All puzzles begin with a gridded board. The orignal levels were n x n squares with n between 5-15 inclusive. On each board, there are pairs of different colored start and end dots that occupy spaces on the board. The objective of each level is to find a continuous path for each color through the board such that 
- none of the paths intersect
- each path connects the start and end point of each color
- the entire board is filled up
